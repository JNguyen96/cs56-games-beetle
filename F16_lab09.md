Some issues the later classes can work on are:




1)  Currently, the user is only told of the beetle being "formed". Add graphics for the user and computers
 beetles that are formed throughout the game.For example: If at the beginning of the game the user rolls the number for the body, 
an image for the body should appear and should remain to be built upon for the rest of the game. (250 points)

2) Allow 2 Players to choose 2 different game modes at the beginning of the game. To add this feature, you'll have to change `BeetleGame.java`.

3) Currently the scoreboard currently refreshes all of the scores after every roll. This can be improved by using the Observer design 
pattern to update the scoreboard instead.
