1. Beetle, is a game in which the player tries to collect as many anatomical body parts of a certain insect/person as possible to create a full insect/person. The player clicks "roll" and randomly gets a body part, first player to complete a full insect/person wins. 

2. As a user I can select from a series of different insects such as an ant, ladybug, beetle and even a human so that if the player selects say an ant, a picture of a complete ant appears in a box and its anatomical body parts and their counts appear on each side of the 
window (left side, representing your side, right, your opponent's). As a user, if I select beetle, then the same thing occurs just a picture of a beetle appears along with its specific body parts. As a user I can select to play with another person (in which both users must enter in their names), or I can choose to play with the computer, that way I, the user, can play with a friend or single player. As say an ant, the player must continuously select roll until their own insect/person is complete no matter who completed their insect/person
first. As a player, with each roll click, I can see what I rolled and what my opponent rolled as well.
 

3. The code builds and runs. In addition, it seems to function as intended to. The window opens, you are prompted to select gamemode (single player, two-player), after you make your selection you enter in your desired userID and you play the game as described above. 

4. The first addition that can be added is incomplete pictures of the selected insect/person. As of now you see a full image of the insect and the only way of knowing whether you won or not is based on the displayed counts which is counter intuitive and boring. The second addition I would make, is to clean up the in-game window. As of now you see lots of text that makes for a very unorganized and not intuitive game. I feel if there was perhaps a background color along with better labels and organization, the game would feel much more playable. Finally a third feature I would add is perhaps some in-game sound effects. When the user presses "roll", a sound of a rolling dice would play in the background. In addition, perhaps some background music when the player is in the main menu.

5. What could be added is a more in depth description of what the author refers to as "levels". From playing the game it isn't immediatley clear that the different insects correspond to different levels. In addition the respective difficulties aren't clear in the description. I feel a few sentences clearfying what the different levels mean would make for a better description. 

6. Regarding the Build.xml targets, the standard compile, clean, run targets have descriptions, however the targets "jar" and "download" don't have a description which would help make the build.xml make more sense.  

7. Yes there are enough issues to this project. There are graphic issues along with text display issues that make the game counter intuitive. The issues are clear with respect to their expecations. The game has serious design flaws that make it very difficult to play. Additions such as improving the design of the main game window would make the game certainly more playable.

9. Regarding the code, the structure to the classes is very intuitive. The methods have pre/post condition comments that make understanding the methods easy. The author utilized switch cases where there were lots of conditions making it easier for a later coder to read, (also it is a personal preferance). As mentioned in the ReadMe, each level (i.e. ant, beetle etc.) is given its own class that extends the player class. This is convenient because if I want to add another level, all I have to do is extend the player class and I can inherit all of the Player class's member functions/variables. What I would have liked to see is more descriptive comments in both the GuiBased class and the TextBased class describing what certain line segments of code do (or display) to make reading the code easier. If I had to describe the code to another programmer; the code is launched in BeetleGame.java, there in the main function you create a new "BeetleGame" object as well as a new "TextBased" and "GuiBased" object (depending on player's selection). Once the GuiBased object is created, looking at the GuiBased.java that is where the JFrame and other GUI swing objects are created. GuiBased.java is also where the code for the user opponent selection exists (single or two player). In addition, within mainFrame method, the user selects the level he/she wishes to play (ant, ladybug, person etc. ). Once the user selects a difficulty, a new player object is created and then is the extending subclass object is created based on the player's selection (ant.java, Person.java etc.). 

10. There aren't any JUnit tests for this game. The game itself is built around random chance so it would be difficult to write any assert tests to confirm the game functions based on expected values. We could perhaps write JUnit tests for when the program runs prior to running the game iteslf.
