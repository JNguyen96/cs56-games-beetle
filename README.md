cs56-games-beetle
=================
A dice rolling game that you can play against a computer.
The idea is to piece together a beetle by rolling the correct number.
1=body
2=head
3=legs
4=eyes
5=antenna
6=tail
The idea is that you need a body first and foremost. Then you can add a tail, legs and a head. In order to add eyes and antenna you first need a head. Rolling a number that corresponds with a body part that you already have does nothing for your beetle and it is the next players turn.

The gui allows the user to click "roll" and a random number between 1-6 is generated and it will add the correct parts to the beetle. Then it will automatically do the same for the computer player. The system will notify the user of the piece that have been added and whether or not they won or lost.
