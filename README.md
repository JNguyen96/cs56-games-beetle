This is a dice rolling game in which the user can choose between four levels: Beetle, Ant, Person, and Ladybug. 
The game can be played against the computer or against another person.
This game is played by clicking a "Roll" button that randomly rolls a value (1-6) for each play. This value corrensponds to the number on a dice and each number represents a body part of the insect/person trying to be created.
The player must first roll the number representing the "body" or "thorax" before adding on other parts of the insect/person.
The game is won by being the first player to roll all parts of the insect/person.
